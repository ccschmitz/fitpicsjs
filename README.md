fitpicsjs
=========

Hi all

This is a project that aims to make photo fitting easy. It's a library that aims to help create galleries like flickr, masonry, isotope etc. Im looking for contributers to help make this an AWESOME. The aim is to have NO dependencies, thats right. 

So far i have implemented the linear_partition algorithm in clean javascript. I've also made a small model with prototype functions for photos, but this is subject to change.
Create beatiful galleries, NO DEPENDENCIES
